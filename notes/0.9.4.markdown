Updates for compatibility with latest Lift 3.1.0 milestone (M1 in particular).
Lift 3.0 was updated to 3.0.1 instead of the previous release candidate.
A recompile of the plugin against Lift 3.1.0-M1 also resolved some bytecode-level issues.
Added support for Scala 2.12 against Lift editions 3.0 and 3.1.
